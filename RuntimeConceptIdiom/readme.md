# Runtime Concept Idiom example

This project implements the Runtime Concept Idiom, described by Sean Parent in
[this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGcVXgEVMJg), in the context of the
Command design pattern.

## Build
The project was tested with Visual Studio 2022 in Windows, and gcc-9.3 in Linux.
It has no dependencies except for gtest/gmock, which it attempts to download by itself.

## Running the tests
Running the `RuntimeConceptIdiomTest` target will run all the tests.
